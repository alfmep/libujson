.SH NAME
ujson-verify \- Check for errors in a JSON document


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ujson-verify
[OPTIONS...] [FILE...]


.SH DESCRIPTION
ujson-verify is a utility used for verifying that JSON documents are syntactically correct. If all the files on the command line are successfully verified, ujson-verify exits with code 0. If any file fails verification, ujson-verify exits with code 1. If no file name is given, a JSON document is read from standard input.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -r, --relaxed
Relaxed parsing, don't use strict mode when parsing.
.TP
.B -s, --schema=FILE
Validate the JSON document with a schema file. This option can be used multiple times. The first schema will be used to validate the JSON document. All schemas added after the first are schemas that can be referenced by the first schema.
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
Silent mode, don't write anything to standard output.
.TP
.B -v, --version
Print version and exit.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Print help and exit.


.SH NOTES
By default JSON documents are verified using the official JSON syntax. But libujson also support a more relaxed format.
.PP
The following is allowed in JSON documents when relaxed format is used:

.nf
- C-style comments.
- String values can be split up into more than one string separated by whitespace or comments.
- Object definitions are allowed to end with a separator(,).
- Array items are allowed to end with a separator(,).
- In object definitions, a member name can be an identifier instead of a string.
  An identifier is a name with the following format: [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*
  Exceptions are: true, false, and null (case insensitive).
  Those names are reserved and are not allowed to be used as identifiers (i.e. without enclosing double quotes).

.PP
Example of a JSON document that is allowed in relaxed mode:

.EX
{
    /*
     * An invalid JSON syntax in strict mode, but allowed in relaxed mode.
     */
    name: "relaxed document",
    value: 42,
    desc: "Some text here",
    "normal_member_name": "Another string",

    // The following object member name must be enclosed by double quotes
    "null": 0,

    long_string: "This is a string value on " // This can be used to
                 "more than one line that, "  // make it more readable.
                 "when parsed, will be one "
                 "long string value.",

    // Note that the last array item ends with a separator
    list_of_values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,],

    // Also, the last object member can end with a separator
    last_member: true,
}
